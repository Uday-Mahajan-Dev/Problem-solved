# Problem-solved
lets dive into the world of coding and solve problems like its a game.

Today I am uploading a basic array problem where we initialize an array first and then give string values to array indices and then fetch them to display them the syntax helps us in understanding basic array working.

I will upload further problems soon that will help solve hard array problems with ease.

I will try to add comments in code to make everything understandable.

Today I added a new java code which takes input in the array and returns the answer in descending order. 

This helps to understand more about for loops and Arrays.sort() function.

PrimeDescending.java code helps to print prime number between 100-1000 in descending order.

Here we run the for loop from 999 to 99 with decrementing i and also a nested j for loop whle the if statement check for if the value is prime or not and prints the result.
