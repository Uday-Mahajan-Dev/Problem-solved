# Problem-solved
lets dive into the world of coding and solve problems like its a game.

Today I am uploading a basic array problem where we initialize an array first and then give string values to array indices and then fetch them to display them the syntax helps us in understanding basic array working.

I will upload further problems soon that will help solve hard array problems with ease.

I will try to add comments in code to make everything understandable.
